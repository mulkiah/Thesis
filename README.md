# Thesis

My master thesis project about compression-encryption
I'm using GAN for Image Compression and Chaotic Map for encryption.

I choose encryption topic because my bachelor degree was Mathematics, and my research interest during undergraduate is about trinion number and it can be used in image encryption.
My past research : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308118488_Real_matrix_representation_for_trinion_numbers_and_its_properties

paper about the use of trinion number in color image encryption:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343262222_Color_image_encryption_based_on_discrete_trinion_Fourier_transform_and_random-multiresolution_singular_value_decomposition

In the future, I wish I can do research about hypercomplex number valued deep learning.
